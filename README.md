# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Model Validation and XG Boost to Starbucks Customer Survey data for better understand:

1. What factors affect to customers loyalty
2. How income, location, and visit rate contributed to customers loyalty
3. What income clasification tah fit the Starbucks market

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here. This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


# File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.


# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
