## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Jupyter Notebook.

## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first project as a student from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) "Data Science Nanodegree Program". I was interestested using Data Visualization, Model Validation, and XG Boost to Starbucks Customer Survey data for better understand:

1. What factors affect to customers loyalty?
2. How income, location, and visit rate contributed to customers loyalty?
3. What coffee shop classification that can compete Starbucks market?

## 3. File Descriptions <a name="desc"></a>

1. Jupyter Notebook that contain work related to the above questions was uploaded using `.ipynb` file.
2. If you would like to access the datasets to explore more analysis you can find `.csv` file.

## 4. Results <a name="results"></a>

For answer 3 questions from project motivations above, you can look at main findings here:

1. [Medium blogpost](https://medium.com/@bernalp/starting-a-coffee-shop-basic-things-to-research-bfee623472f).
2. `sb-visual.ipynb`
3. `customer-loyalty.ipynb`

The link and `.ipynb` file provided general and technical explanation to answer those questions.

## 5. Credits <a name="credits"></a>
